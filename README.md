<p>Hi, I'm Tanmay, a pre-final year CSE student at IIIT Naya Raipur with a strong understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms and some web development experience, having built websites utilizing the MERN stack. Blockchain technology fascinates me, and I'm actively learning about it. A team player who can work under pressure and is always up for a challenge. <img float="right" width="50%" src="https://github.com/TanmayNikam/TanmayNikam/blob/main/images/web_developer.gif">  </p>
